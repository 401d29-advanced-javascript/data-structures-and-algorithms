##Array-Binary-Search
--Write a function called BinarySearch which takes
--in 2 parameters: a SORTED ARRAY and the SEARCH KEY.
--Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available
--to your language. RETURN the INDEX of the array's ELEMENT
--that is equal to the search key, or -1, if the element
does not exist.
--
--EX: input: [4,8,15,16,23,42], 15
--EX: output: 2

--EX: input: [4,8,15,16,23,42], 90
--EX: output: -1

##Challenge
--The main challenge was figure out how to resize the array after the midpoint was found in the larger array.

##Approach & Efficiency
--Started by writing out the Problem Domain, then the Visuals based on what we wanted to accomplish and used visuals (no code) to walk ourselves through the process from start to finish
--Began writing pseudo code and skipped over the challenged we faced of not knowing how to resize the array based on where the midpoint was

##Solution
We did not end up writing any actual code for this code challenge
